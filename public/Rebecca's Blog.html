  <h2>A letter to my future self, written on the first day of school</h2>

  <h3>Dear Future-Rebecca,</h3>

  <p>If you are reading this, it means you are likely about to cry vigorously in the shower and/or stay up past 2 AM eating Better Cheddars the night before an assignment is due. In the former case: go ahead, come back when you’re done, and in the latter: stop that now, fool, you are not 16 anymore. </p>

  <p>This is to remind you of why you’re starting this, and how you’re going to survive, maybe even flourish. </p>

  <p>You are probably feeling one of the various facets of perceived ineptitude: frustration, anger, despair, self-doubt, hunger, and drunkenness - those last two you may have outgrown, but I leave them based on College-Rebecca’s shenanigans. You may have found a bug you can’t exterminate, an algorithm you can’t crack, or a misogynist you can’t punch in the face - whatever the Goliath, it is not your first skirmish nor will it be your last. I want to pause and give credence to what you’re going through. There are few things as desolate as the hinterlands of “I can’t.” And honestly, it’s not a landscape you’ve had occasion to traverse very much thus far.</p>

  <p>When you are on the brink of quitting, I want you to remember what it felt like to be at the beginning of things, before the ravages of embitterment, sleep deprivation, and doubt take over. You are doing this because beyond all the financial incentives, free lunches, cushy workspaces, and general respect to be had in the tech field, you wanted to be challenged. There’s a lot of chatter about tech’s “disruptive” powers, and I leave it up to you whether to drink that particular cup of Kool Aid or no, but regardless of its impact, software development will evolve for the rest of your life and you are looking forward to that dynamism. At your core, you cherish learning more than expertise and for that reason you’re moving into a field that you’ll come to love.</p>

  <p>During the year you’ll have studied more than you ever imagined in a subject, which - let’s face it - no one ever thought you’d be any good at. And maybe you’re never going to achieve the slick grace of the technological elite - that’s okay - it’s probably all artifice anyway. You are here because a village of people believed in you, so you should probably honor that and keep slogging along. One day you might make your endeavors seem effortless to some other neophyte in the room. When that happens, I’ll have to write a different letter. Until then, I hope you find pride in the fact that you’re no longer a special genius rainbow unicorn. You’re kind of a mule. That means you’re imbued with all the magical powers of… mule-dom, namely, intractability, dedication, preparedness, and the fortitude to withstand shitting in a field of nettles.</p>

  <p>If I know you, you’re likely terrified of your impending failure. Don’t be. Remember what work felt like when failure wasn’t a tangible threat? Yeah, it’s better this way - you’re going to fail every goddamn day of your life, so do what you can to prevent a belly flop and when that inevitably happens, fail again with a little more finesse.</p>

  <p>Finally, when you don’t feel like a good programmer, be a good teammate. Sometimes if you can’t be competent in one aspect of your life, you can strive for “not cruel” in another. People who can’t manage this have a bad day at work and come home to hit their kids. Let the success of your classmates offer you buoyancy because their growth, like your own, will be hard-won.</p>

  <p>Be hopeful. Stay humble. You’re gonna be okay.</p>

  <p>With heart in hand,<br>
  First-Day-Of-School-Rebecca</p>

  <h2>An open letter to my orange grove, or lessons from week 2</h2>

  <h3>Dear Orange Grove,</h3>

  <p>I didn’t mean to make you barren. Sorry about that! This is not how I would have had it turn out. It’s not you, it’s me. When I programmed you, I took such care in naming your little machines of words in such a way to invoke your potential loveliness - to craft the permutations of your life’s stages. Instead, you stubbornly refuse to produce fruit and somehow never age past 4. You’re kind of grotesque. My bad. Hey, at least we moved beyond the stage wherein you sat, stillborn on the screen, printing out “Your grove has died.” That was a low point.</p>

  <p>99% of the time when I’m programming, it doesn’t work. How do I feel about this? Well, I’m finding a small degree of peace by putting one foot in front of the other. I can’t say I expected to be Alan Turing from the beginning (or ever.) Poetry and programming, for all the parallels to be made as the “language which makes,” are two vastly different disciplines. Programming will continue to be an uphill battle. However, week 2 is teaching me that my peers are both kind and humble, and that every time I seek out help, I’m actually learning from the problem solving skills of people who have probably written themselves into a Gordian knot at least once before.</p>

  <p>Postscript 1 day later: Fuck yeah orange grove! You grew those 54 phantasmic oranges during your 10th year of existence. Go you! I picked one from each unbroken tree and they tasted like victory.</p>

  <h2>On not being a robot</h2>
  <p> It has been 3 weeks, 4 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes and 44.55 seconds since I started my code adventure with Ada. I know this because I programmed a method to mark the time passed, but the theme of this post will be continuity, not the seemingly manichean division between my life before and after I crossed paths with the tech sphere. Perhaps, like me, you are an errant humanities major, artist manqué, critical critic, radical feminist, or disenchanted educator. Maybe you’re thinking about learning something so laughably foreign that it could leave you destitute in one breathless swoop. You might, understandably, be doubtful of your skill-set, unsure if your past experience and training carry even a feather’s worth of weight. How dare you, the untutored fluff of less well-funded disciplines, encroach on the hallowed space of technology? </p>

  <p>Well, people of all manners of self-identification, here I am writing from the trenches of such a sea change, and the answer is: I have no answers. Yet. </p>

  <p>What I do have after all my apprehensions are let out is an empty box, save for hope. Therefore, as a novice programmer, I offer up its contents. May I never loose touch with them.</p>

  <p>1. I hope I continue celebrating success after struggle - that I’m never blasé about my creations. These days, when I finally write something which works, I’m genuinely ecstatic! I aim not to become inured to the moments of relief and joy which sometimes (rarely) punctuate my hours. As I learn more, I hope their tempo increases with exuberance intact. </p>

  <p>2. I hope to retain the experience of programming as a little bit of magic. Yes, one day I will know what a processor does and what HTTP is and a whole bunch of other things that are beyond the horizon of my current imagination. But even as more technical machinations are revealed in the light of their science, I hope there are still things which inspire the sense of being at the edge of an ocean. We murder to dissect, Wordsworth says. I don’t want that to be my method of comprehension. </p>

  <p>3. I hope to avoiding becoming a robot. Which is to say, I will take the ability to orchestrate others’ edification, emancipation, community, and convenience as the benchmark of technology. I take joy in finding utterly human ways to relate to the mysterious-gremlin-box known as my computer.  </p>

  <p>Will I eventually learn to parrot and parse the arcane technobabble of the humans-as-computer crowd? Of course. I will play that game and I will play it to win. Will I secretly build a universe of inspired language around them? I hope so.</p><br>
