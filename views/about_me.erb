  <p>“Understand that when the beast within you</p>

  <p>succeeds again in paralyzing into unending</p>

  <p>incompletion whatever you again had the temerity to<br>
  try to make</p>

  <p>its triumph is made sweeter by confirmation of its</p>

  <p>rectitude. It knows that it alone<br>
  knows you.”</p>
